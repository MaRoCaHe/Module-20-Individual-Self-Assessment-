# Module 20 Individual Self Assessment

## Summary of the project

For our project, we decided to work with a database that contained the medical history of a number of patients.  The goal was to design a model to try and predict who was at risk of having heart problems and what were the primary causes of it. 

## Self-assessment

For this project, my role was the circle. I was in charge of the database, from creating the mockup, cleaning it, hosting it, and making sure everything was working and organized.

It was important to have an ERD and schema to know what I was going for and help keep it organized. With that, it was easier to make the join and connect de database.

I also completed some visualizations and graphs to help tell the story of our projects and demonstrate our findings we did this with tableau.

## Team assessment

It was great working as a team we supported each other every step along the way, from deciding what the project was going to be about to the presentation, the support has been great, even though we each had our roles, we were all involved and helping each other in whatever was needed.
